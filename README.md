# List_Pagination_and_Filtering
 Second Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project

For this project, I wrote the javascript code in order to encorporate pagination and filtering to make the student directory more user friendly and easy to use. The provided html from Treehouse initially displays 54 student list items with no search function embedded. I wrote multiple javascript functions to encorporate the following features: 

1. Only a max of ten student items are displayed per page
2. A search a bar at the top of the page to allow filtering of students by name.
3. When a search is performed only the filtered names are displayed per page. 
4. Pagination links added to the bottom of the page based on the number of displayed students.
5. A 'your search returned no result' message displays when a user's search returns no results.
